History
-------

Spout was originally written for a handheld by kuni, and soon
afterwards was ported to Windows using cygwin and sdl and released
under the MIT license.

In 2004 a 'unix version' was released, which mostly just slapped
autotools into the windows version and infringed the license.

This is a [Dos-Like](https://mattiasgustavsson.itch.io/dos-like) version, based on Nick's new unix version, based on the original Windows code by kuni.

Compiling
---------

To compile for the web:

```
wasm\node wasm\wajicup.js -template template.html spout.c dos.c spout.html
```

A WebAssembly build environment is required. You can download it (for Windows) here: [github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like/releases/tag/wasm-env](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like/releases/tag/wasm-env).
Unzip it so that the `wasm` folder in the zip file is at your repository root. 

The wasm build environment is a compact distribution of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [clang/wasm-ld](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html),
[WAjic](https://github.com/schellingb/wajic) and [wasm system libraries](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/tree/main/system).
