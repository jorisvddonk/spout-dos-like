History
-------

Spout was originally made for a handheld by kuni, and soon afterwards was ported to Windows using cygwin and sdl, licensed under the MIT license; see http://www.din.or.jp/~ku_/junk/junk.htm#spout
In 2004 a 'unix version' was released, which mostly just slapped autotools into the windows version and infringed the license: http://code.mizzenblog.com/category/spout/
This is a new unix version, based on the original Windows code by kuni, which aims to add useful features and simplify the code.
